      <h2>History of modular arithmetic</h2>
      <p>Modular arithmetic's foundations were first introduced in the third century BCE by an Greek mathematician named Euclid in the 7th book of his book,<i> Elements.</i></p>
      <p>In <i>Elements (The seventh book)</i>, Euclid discusses divisibility, prime numbers, and his algorithm for finding GCDs of large numbers. The book also starts to introduce
      what we now know as "The fundemental theorem of arithmetic", which in number theory states that every positive number (greater than 1) can be written out as a product of primes
      in an unique way.</p>
      <p>This new way of finding GCDs, LCMs, and prime number factorization of large numbers was a huge step forward in the world of math and cryptography.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Modular arithmetic focuses on the quotients and operaters or division operations.<br>In modular arithmetic, the remainder is especially important when dividing two numbers, and when focusing on the remainder, an operater called, the modulo operater is used. Mod operaters and moduar arithmetic are also used often in cryptography.</p>
